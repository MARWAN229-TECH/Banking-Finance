🏦 Banking Analytics & Loan Risk Scoring Model
A comprehensive SQL-based analytics engine designed to optimize bank profitability and manage credit risk.

📊 Business Problem
Modern banks need to identify their most profitable customers while simultaneously monitoring for loan defaults and churn. This project automates those three critical functions using advanced SQL.

🛠️ Technical Features
Revenue Modeling: Calculates real-time interest revenue across Savings, Credit Cards, and Active Loans.

Customer Segmentation: Automatically assigns customers to High, Medium, or Low Value tiers based on total revenue generation.

Automated Risk Scoring: A 5-tier risk engine that flags 'High Risk' active loans by crossing Credit Scores (< 600) with current loan status.

Churn Activity Tracking: Uses date-diff logic to segment users into Active, At Risk, Dormant, or Churned based on transaction recency.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Advanced SQL: Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Case Logic.

Financial Literacy: Understanding of interest rates, loan statuses, and profitability tiers.
